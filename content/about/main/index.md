  Livestock production contributes 14%-17% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, comparable to emissions from all vehicles. Sub-Saharan Africa's livestock, mainly in smallholder agricultural systems, emit more GHGs than Europe and the US due to low-quality feed. Recent research reveals that cattle in the region emit 1000 kg of CO2 per kg of protein produced, making it a GHG hotspot. To tackle this, my PhD research integrates earth observation and ground data to study livestock feed production and consumption in East Africa. By improving our understanding of livestock diets, we can enhance GHG emission calculations and develop strategies for reducing their environmental impact.
