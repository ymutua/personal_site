<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom. :gb: 

My research is aimed at quantifying livestock diets for improved estimation of greenhouse 
gas emissions from livestock systems in Kenya. Prior to beginning my PhD, I worked as a geospatial analyst at [Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT](https://alliancebioversityciat.org), a research and development organisation affiliated with the CGIAR. I hold a master’s degree in Climate Change Adaptation from University of Nairobi and a Bachelor’s degree in Geography from Moi University, Kenya.
