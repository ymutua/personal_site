Maps have been part of human history for a long time; representing the real world on paper and now via the [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping). The process should be simple, but itâ€™s often challenging to non-GIS people. 

Software such as [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) and [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) have made map making an easy process, while you will need a license to use the former, the latter is a free and open-source software (FOSS). 

However, R - a statistical programming language has spatial capabilities that can be used for map making. This tutorial introduces the fundamentals of map making using R.

For this tutorial, we will need several pckages that can be installed with:

```{r pkg-install-all, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggspatial", "sf", "rnaturalearth"))
```

First, we set our working directory. This is the place where you will read and keep all your outputs.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iDir <- "~/"
```

We then load two packages, (i) `ggplot2` and (ii) `sf`, these are necessary for all maps.

```{r pkg-ggplot2-sf}
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
```

We access a map of entire countries of the world using `rnaturalearth` package and further through `ne_countries` function, pull country level data.

```{r pkg-rnatural}
library("rnaturalearth")

aoi <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
```

We now have data that we can plot by creating a base map of the world using `ggplot2` package and `ggplot` function as shown below.

```{r world-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = aoi) +
  geom_sf()
```

Further, we can add a title using `ggtitle` function, By default, Axis names are absent on a map, but can be changed to more suitable ones like "Longitude"...."Latitude".

```{r world-title, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = aoi) +
  geom_sf() +
  xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") +
  ggtitle("World map", subtitle = paste0("(", length(unique(aoi$NAME)), " countries)"))
```

We now add some color by filling the polygons of the countries with a color, using argument `fill` and red for the outline of the countries using argument `color`.

```{r world-colors, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = aoi) + 
  geom_sf(color = "red", fill = "blue")
```

Visualization can get more interesting when you can show a gradient on one variable of the data - here we show the population of each country using the `viridis` scale through the `option = "plasma"`.

```{r world-colors-pop, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = aoi) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = pop_est)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma")
```

The object `aoi` contains various data that can be visualized. You can view what's vailable through `names(world)`. Here we visualize economies.

```{r world-colors-economy, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = aoi) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = economy)) +
    scale_fill_discrete()
```

We can zoom in to any area of interest e.g Kenya, by setting the extent of the map using `coord_sf` function, and providing limits on the x-axis (`xlim`), and on the y-axis (`ylim`).

```{r world-zoom}
ggplot(data = aoi) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(33, 42), ylim = c(-5, 5.9), expand = FALSE)
```

And add afew more elements to the map, but lets first load the `ggspatial` package through `library(ggspatial)`. Check out these functions: `annotation_scale`, `annotation_north_arrow` and `coord_sf` and arguments: `legend.position` will automatically place the legend at a specific location, `panel.grid.major` and `panel.grid.minor` sets grid lines to gray color and have them appear dashed, `panel.background` colors the background. For more arguments see the function `theme`.

```{r kenya-final}
ggplot(data = aoi) +
  geom_sf(fill= "antiquewhite") +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.45) +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "bl", which_north = "true", 
                         pad_x = unit(0.6, "in"), pad_y = unit(0.4, "in"),
                         style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(33, 42), ylim = c(-5, 5.9), expand = FALSE) +
  xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") +
  ggtitle("Map of Kenya")
```

Finally we save the map using `ggsave` function. Luckily, we have a choice of image formats to chose from e.g. PNG, JPEG, PDF etc Here we use PNG which is good for the web.

```{r my_map-ggsave, eval = FALSE}
ggsave(paste0(iDir, "/"), "my_map.png", width = 6, height = 6, dpi = "screen")
```
