A substantial part of my work over the years has been on crop and livestock systems, where I work to understand their functioning and response in East Africa, and how they can be transformed to be more productive. I have focused on how spatial modeling can contribute to decision making agricultural systems. 

My research is transforming! towards livestock systems. A year ago, I led the development of [a new method to map and assess heat stress in pigs](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1751731120000865). The results have been used to guide future investments and policy changes in Uganda. Further, the method has been further refined and consequently been applied across East Africa to [highlight hot-spot areas of heat stress for six different livestock species](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-021-00226-8) and [dairy cattle in West Africa](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02733-2).

Stay tuned for more, it's exciting!
