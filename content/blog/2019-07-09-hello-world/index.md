Right here is the place where I share my analytical and programming projects, using languages and tools such as R, Python, ArcGIS, QGIS etc.

In future, I plan to have a tutorial section for more detailed introduction into a topic. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:ymutua@gmail.com) if you have exciting suggestions or questions!
