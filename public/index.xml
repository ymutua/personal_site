      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.</description>

      <title>Extract weather and climate data from online repositories</title>

      <description>In a world experiencing climate change, good weather and climate data matters. It may be available but often hard to find, understand and apply to decision-making mainly because:
There are no weather stations everywhere Weather stations are not in good condition (gaps) The data is not stored correctly The data does not pass the basic quality controls Access to data is restricted However, weather and climate data products derived from satellites and model-based reanalysis have been used in locations where station based observations are inadequate or incomplete.</description>

      <title>Map making with R</title>
      <link>/blog/2019-08-13-map-making-with-r/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2019-08-13-map-making-with-r/</guid>
      <description>Maps have been part of human history for a long time; representing the real world on paper and now via the web. The process should be simple, but it’s often challenging to non-GIS people.
Software such as ArcGIS and QGIS have made map making an easy process, while you will need a license to use the former, the latter is a free and open-source software (FOSS).
However, R - a statistical programming language has spatial capabilities that can be used for map making.</description>
