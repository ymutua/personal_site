However, R - a statistical programming language has spatial capabilities that can be used for map making.</description>

      <description>Right here is the place where I share my analytical and programming projects, using languages and tools such as R, Python, ArcGIS, QGIS etc.
In future, I plan to have a tutorial section for more detailed introduction into a topic. Please feel free to contact me if you have exciting suggestions or questions!</description>
